.TH git-annex-numcopies 1
.SH NAME
git-annex-numcopies \- configure desired number of copies
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
git annex numcopies \fBN\fP
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tells git-annex how many copies it should preserve of files, over all
repositories. The default is 1. 
.PP
Run without a number to get the current value.
.PP
This configuration is stored in the git-annex branch, so it will be seen
by all clones of the repository. It can be overridden on a per\-file basis
by the annex.numcopies setting in .gitattributes files, or can be
overridden temporarily with the \-\-numcopies option.
.PP
When git-annex is asked to drop a file, it first verifies that the
number of copies can be satisfied among all the other
repositories that have a copy of the file.
.PP
In unusual situations, involving special remotes that do not support
locking, and concurrent drops of the same content from multiple
repositories, git-annex may violate the numcopies setting. It still
guarantees at least 1 copy is preserved. This can be configured by
using git-annex\-mincopies(1)
