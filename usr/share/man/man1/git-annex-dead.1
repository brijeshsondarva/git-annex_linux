.TH git-annex-dead 1
.SH NAME
git-annex-dead \- hide a lost repository or key
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
git annex dead \fB[repository ...] [\-\-key somekey]\fP
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command exists to deal with situations where data has been lost,
and you know it has, and you want to stop being reminded of that fact.
.PP
When a repository is specified, indicates that the repository has
been irretrievably lost, so it will not be listed in eg, \fBgit annex info\fP.
Repositories can be specified using their remote name, their
description, or their UUID. (To undo, use \fBgit-annex semitrust\fP.)
.PP
When a key is specified, indicates that the content of that key has been
irretrievably lost. This prevents commands like \fBgit annex fsck \-\-all\fP
from complaining about it. 
(To undo, add the key's content back to the repository, 
by using eg, \fBgit-annex reinject\fP.)
