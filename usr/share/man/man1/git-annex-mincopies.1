.TH git-annex-mincopies 1
.SH NAME
git-annex-mincopies \- configure minimum number of copies
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
git annex mincopies \fBN\fP
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tells git-annex how many copies it is required to preserve of files, over all
repositories. The default is 1.
.PP
Run without a number to get the current value.
.PP
This configuration is stored in the git-annex branch, so it will be seen
by all clones of the repository. It can be overridden on a per\-file basis
by the annex.mincopies setting in .gitattributes files, or can be
overridden temporarily with the \-\-mincopies option.
.PP
This supplements the git-annex\-numcopies(1) setting. 
In unusual situations, involving special remotes that do not support
locking, and concurrent drops of the same content from multiple
repositories, git-annex may violate the numcopies setting.
In these unusual situations, git-annex ensures that the number of copies
never goes below mincopies.
.PP
It is a good idea to not only rely on only setting mincopies. Set
numcopies as well, to a larger number, and keep mincopies at the
bare minimum you're comfortable with. Setting mincopies to a large
number, rather than setting numcopies will in some cases prevent
droping content in entirely safe situations.
